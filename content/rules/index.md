1. **Be Friendly and Respectful**  
This space is meant to be friendly and welcoming, so please keep it that way.
2. **Be Patient**  
Everyone's different in variety of ways, remember that.
3. **Be Careful with Heated Topics**  
If you know in advance that a certain topic will quickly escalate or derail, please refrain from starting it. Political discussions are allowed as long as you keep it civil and don't make it personal.
4. **No Toxicity, Doxxing, and Traumadumping**  
Seriously, we have enough of that already. There is a difference between venting and traumadumping, but as it's pretty blurry try to keep it to a minimum.
5. **No NSFW or Suggestive Content**  
As per [Discord's TOS](https://discord.com/terms/#2), this server can be viewed by anyone as young as 13.
6. **Keep Conversations in English**  
Many members are polyglots, but not all. The use of foreign languages also makes moderation more difficult. However, if the conversation is mainly in English and a member, for example, asks for the meaning of a particular foreign word, that's fine.
7. **Keep Profanity to a Minimum**  
Swearing is okay, as long as you don't do it excessively.
8. **Include Latin Characters in your Name**  
Please at least have letters from the English alphabet instead of having your name fully in Egyptian Hieroglyphics. It would be annoying for screen reader users and generally is annoying. 
9. **Don't Encourage Others in Breaking the Rules**  
Doing so will count as breaking the rule by yourself.
10. **Don't Spam and Don't Mention Users without Need**  
Even if the spam is unintentional, automated moderation can think it is.
11. **Don't Try to Find Loopholes in the Rules**  
Want to speedrun getting banned? Just ask `@Moderator` to do so.

<summary>TL;DR</summary>

![Meme titled "Be friendly" with a stretched image of Twilight Sparkle, followed by the text: Don't engage with rude people online. And make sure you behave yourself - Don't offend anyone. When communicating on the Internet, be kind to others. Avoid using harsh words! You might unintentionally hurt someone, And reading rude comments is just as unpleasant as hearing them.](be-friendly.png#transparent#no-hover)

The rules may be changed at any time. Improvement proposals are welcome.

## Punishment

Generally, before any serious punishment, users will be warned three times:

- **First warning:** 30 minutes mute.
- **Second warning:** 1 day mute.
- **Third warning:** Kick.

If the user continues to be nasty, they will be:

- Banned with appeal.
- Permanently banned.

However, if the user's actions are too nasty, levels may be skipped depending on the severity of the nastiness.

## Appeal

If you feel that you have been unfairly punished, feel free to discuss it with the [admin](https://daudix.one/home/#contacts) or one of the moderators. Misunderstandings do happen.
