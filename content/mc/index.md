Thanks to [kevadesu](https://kevadesu.github.io/)'s initiative, we have an official Minecraft server for Snug Nook members. They provided the hosting, configuration, and everything else, while I only provided the subdomain, `mc.daudix.one`.

## Version

Currently we're running Minecraft <mark>v1.21.1</mark>.

## Access

Access to this server is limited to Snug Nook members only. If you would like to play on this server, join [Snug Nook](@/_index.md).

To join:

- In Minecraft, connect to `mc.daudix.one`
- In Snug Nook, message `/register <nickname>`
- Check your DMs for "RSCC AuthAgents" and click accept.

## Mods/Resource Packs

To improve and make the experience more fun, our server uses a few Fabric mods:

- [Concurrent Chunk Management Engine](https://modrinth.com/mod/c2me-fabric)
- [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons)
- [Incendium](https://modrinth.com/datapack/incendium)
- [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports)
- [Noisium](https://modrinth.com/mod/noisium)
- [Nullscape](https://modrinth.com/datapack/nullscape)
- [Plasmo Voice](https://modrinth.com/plugin/plasmo-voice)
- [Terralith](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terralith)

You don't need to install any of these to play. However, for the full experience, you can install the following mods:

- [Plasmo Voice](https://modrinth.com/plugin/plasmo-voice)
- [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap)

And the [Sparkles](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/sparkles) resource pack. 

## Rules

All [Snug Nook rules](@/rules/index.md) apply to the in-game chat. Consequences for breaking the rules in the in-game chat are the same as for breaking the rules in any of Snug Nook's chats.

In addition to the above, griefing, turning the server into 2b2t, and overall ruining the fun for everyone, will result in action.
